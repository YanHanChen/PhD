\description{
This data set consists of the abundance and phylogenetic tree of 46 vascular plant species collected
in the period 2002-2009 along the Tyrrhenian coast from three successively less extreme foredune
habitats: emboryo dunes (ED, 17 species), mobile dunes (MD, 39 species) and transition dunes (TD, 42
species). See the vignette for part of the data in the required input format, and Carboni et al. (2010, 2011) for sampling details and habitat descriptions.
