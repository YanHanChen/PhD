Title: Phylogenetic Diversity
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Anne Chao, Yan-Han Chen and Chun-Huo Chiu
Maintainer: Anne Chao <chao@stat.nthu.edu.tw>
Description: (1) The iNEXT standardization for phylogenetic diversity: computes and plots rarefaction and extrapolation of phylogenetic diversity based on two types of standardization methods (sample size and sample coverage). (2) The phylogenetic diversity estimation: computes and plots asymptotic phylogenetic diversity profile as a function of diversity order (q-profile) or time (time-profile). PhD is an expanded and updated version of the old package iNextPD by adding more features. The iNextPD has been removed from CRAN. Use PhD to replace iNextPD.
